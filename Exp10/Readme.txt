There is one AP(100,100)

two fixed node
one moving node initially at (130,100), this point is moveded a loop.

we can see that after some point of time there is no respone from server.
From the coordinates at that time we calculate max distance.

moving bode final point = (151,100)
therefore max range = 151.
